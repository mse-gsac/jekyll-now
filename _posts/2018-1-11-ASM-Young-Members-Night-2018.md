The 32nd Annual ASM Young Members Night is around the corner! There will be a dinner provided for free to any students who [RSVP](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqnxSWCSabRwEp_uQcZj_nEQvoXdVxGc29d2gMIwtkEe6uPg/viewform) before Feb. 9, 2018 at noon!

ASM Young Members’ Night engages undergraduate and graduate materials science students at the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, and Robert Morris University by fostering the development of relationships between students and professionals in local industries.

### Main Speaker:
Dr. Chetali Gupta

### Topic:
Life After Grad School: The Early Years
- Transitioning from school to work can be a challenge as young professionals are trying their best to show their capabilities, but it is important for this to be done smoothly, as to maintain a good work-life balance. This presentation will focus on life after grad school and adjusting to industry in the early years.
- __Chetali Gupta__ is currently a Research Chemist at PPG in the automotive division at the Coatings Innovation Center in Pittsburgh. She is responsible for developing new formulations for various OEM manufacturers in the adhesives, sealants and NVH (noise vibration harshness) group. She is also a part of the rheology support team for different products within PPG. Chetali earned her B.S in Chemical Engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2013. She did an internship at Materials Modification Inc, a Department of Defense contractor, where she worked on bullet proof armor using polyvinyl siloxanes during her undergraduate degree (2010-2013). She received her masters and PhD in Materials Science and Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in 2017 under Prof. Newell Washburn. Chetali worked on enhancing the interfacial activity of lignin using different grafting agents primarily in high solids systems such as cement. During her time at CMU she was the author of 13 publications and one provisional patent application. Chetali was also involved in a NSF I-Corps program during her time at CMU, aimed at helping university research build startups, where she also received an award for Top Entrepreneurial Lead. She was actively involved in the Graduate Student Association of CMU where she held a leadership position of VP of Internal Affairs.

### Student Speaker:
Ross Cunningham

### Topic:
Additive Manufacturing (abstract coming soon!)

### Poster Contest
There will be a poster contest for all undergraduate and graduate students in the Pittsburgh area (though not mandatory for event attendees)! Come show all of your hard work for a chance to win a cash prize! Posters will be judged on technical content (50%), quality of illustrations (30%), and quality of layout/ illustration (20%). Your name and school will be covered to remove any biases the judges may carry. Your poster will be judged on its own from 5:30 to 6:30pm and there will be no speaking to the judges!
