Main Speaker: Dr. Chetali Gupta

Topic: Life After Grad School: The Early Years
- Transitioning from school to work can be a challenge as young professionals are trying their best to show their capabilities, but it is important for this to be done smoothly, as to maintain a good work-life balance. This presentation will focus on life after grad school and adjusting to industry in the early years.
- Chetali Gupta is currently a Research Chemist at PPG in the automotive division at the Coatings Innovation Center in Pittsburgh. She is responsible for developing new formulations for various OEM manufacturers in the adhesives, sealants and NVH (noise vibration harshness) group. She is also a part of the rheology support team for different products within PPG. Chetali earned her B.S in Chemical Engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2013. She did an internship at Materials Modification Inc, a Department of Defense contractor, where she worked on bullet proof armor using polyvinyl siloxanes during her undergraduate degree (2010-2013). She received her masters and PhD in Materials Science and Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in 2017 under Prof. Newell Washburn. Chetali worked on enhancing the interfacial activity of lignin using different grafting agents primarily in high solids systems such as cement. During her time at CMU she was the author of 13 publications and one provisional patent application. Chetali was also involved in a NSF I-Corps program during her time at CMU, aimed at helping university research build startups, where she also received an award for Top Entrepreneurial Lead. She was actively involved in the Graduate Student Association of CMU where she held a leadership position of VP of Internal Affairs.
